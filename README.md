## Survival Analysis of

## Game of Thrones

# Characters

#### ABSTRACT

The hit HBO drama series Game of Thrones has become notorious for its shocking and ruthless killings of major characters throughout its run. In this  whitepaper I try to identify the main risk covariates that would predict survival using Kaplan-Meier estimators, Cox regression, Elastic Net and stepwise methods for variable selection



## 1 INTRODUCTION

###### Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally famous book series "A Song of Fire and Ice" by

###### George RR Martin. The show is well known for its vastly complicated political landscape, large number of

###### characters, and its frequent character deaths.

###### In this analysis weâ€™ll use a dataset containing right censored data on survival for 359 characters of the show series

###### along with some data of their death, allegiance, sex, religion, occupation, social status, etc.

###### The intention of this study is to analyze survival for different groups and develop a model that can accurately

###### predict death risk for a given set of covariates.
